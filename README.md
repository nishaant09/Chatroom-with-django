# Chatroom-with-django
Created a chatroom using Django for the back-end and bootstrap html css for the fornt end, this was my first personal project, learnt many new things.
Obviously requires immporvements, will try my nest to make an updated version.
Faced some  difficulty while connecting the urls.py to views.py
Took reference from a youtube video.(link to be attached)
