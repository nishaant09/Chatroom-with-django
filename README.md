# Chatroom-with-django
Created a chatroom using Django for the back-end and boot strap HTML-CSS for the front end.
The chatroom allows multiple users to login with just their username and chat with other people who have loged in as well.
Scope of improvement can be the maintainence of database with exclusive passwords for each user.
The UI/UX of the chatroom also requires a large amount of improvement, working on it.
